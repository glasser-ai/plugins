## Triage Overview

| Class               | Count | P0 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ----- | -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| live-issue          | 0     | 0  | Potential runtime breakage in the target OpenClaw/plugin pair. P0 only when it is not a deprecated compat seam.                                          |
| compat-gap          | 0     | -  | Compatibility behavior is needed but missing from the target OpenClaw compat registry.                                                                   |
| deprecation-warning | 0     | -  | Plugin uses a supported but deprecated compatibility seam; keep it wired while migration exists.                                                         |
| inspector-gap       | 0     | -  | Plugin Inspector needs stronger capture/probe evidence before making contract judgments. Runtime-covered rows are proof-backed and not open report work. |
| upstream-metadata   | 1     | -  | Plugin package or manifest metadata should improve upstream; not a target OpenClaw live break by itself.                                                 |
| fixture-regression  | 0     | -  | Fixture no longer exposes an expected seam; investigate fixture pin or scanner drift.                                                                    |
